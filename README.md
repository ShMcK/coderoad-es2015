## Outline

### Declaring Variables

Using `let` & `const`.

##### Let

`let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used.

This is unlike the `var` keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

```js
var global = true;
let blockScoped = true;
```

##### Const

Writing basic functions continued.

We'll write two more basic functions, this time without any help.
